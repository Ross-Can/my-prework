## MAD DEMO

### App Description
We've had moments where communication is annoyingly difficult. You type words down and people complain that the text is <i>too small</i>. You make the words bigger, but someone else complains that they can only comprehend orange text on a green background. You give them what they want and yet still recieve complaints about your iphone screen being too dirty. Thus, leading you to search for an easy way to tell them "bye".
